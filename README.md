# Analyzing IoT-related CVEs Exploited by Nation-State Threat Actors (NSTAs)
This repository includes several Jupyter Notebooks dedicated to exploratory data analysis of datasets gathered from the NVD, MITRE corporation, and CISA. This project will eventually contain a machine learning model that will help associate CVEs with IoT devices and the NSTAs that exploit them.
