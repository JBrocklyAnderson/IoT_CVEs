    "### Extracting Data from the CVE List\n",
    "There are precisely $260,896$ records in the CVE list; each is represented by a single JSON file. These files contain all the information (though lots of it is incomplete) that will populate our `CVE_df` dataframe. It was clear after creating the initial script that massive discrepencacies existed between the files' structures. This makes it especially complicated to reliably retrieve desired values, but I managed to create a recursive function that performs various data retrieval processes based on the kind of data type the object holds at every level on its way to pull out the desired info. Based on the CVE List schema, I figured that the most important information—and really, the only kinds of information contained in the files that would be useful to us—would be the CVE ID, the CWE ID, the description, the date the record was published, a categorical and numerical severity score, the vector of attack used in the CVE, and attack complexity.\n",

    "### Extracting Data from the CWE List\n",
    "The CWE list contains lots of information that could be pertinant to our analysis that's relatively easy to access. Among these I counted the CWE IDs, names, descriptions, related CWEs, the nature of these relationships, the technological vector (web-based, network, etc.), background details, the phases of development wherein the weakness could be introduced, descriptions about these unfortunate events, the likelihood of these weaknesses, the scope and impact of the weakness's common consequences, detection methods and their descriptions and effectiveness, mitigation strategies, potential vulnerabilities, observed vulnerabilities (with direct references to CVE IDs), and more. Because of the observed vulnerabilities, we can merge together these two dataframes and clean and filter the resultant so that we have a comprehensive dataset to work with. Because there's so much text data in the CWE list, we should have plenty of information to feed into a matural language processing pipeline that can help build a classification model to predict the association of a given CVE with the IoT and it's various vulnerabilities.\n",

    "I created several helper functions to get us from `A` to `B`. The first, I can just feed the XML file. Next, we have a function that takes an element and takes all of the text data inside of it and it's children nodes and returns it as a long sentence. This kind of column data will be useful when we tokenize and lemmatize the text to more accurately search for our desire IoT-vulnerability-related keywords."

    "## Saving the Data\n",
    "Parquet is a file type that streamlines the storage and retrieval of columnar data. I also saved a copy of both dataframes to CSV (a basic type of spreadsheet file). I chose to use the default option `None` for the method's `index` parameter, which saves the index of each record in a special kind of metadata range loop. This means it won't take up the kind of memory it would have if the index was actually saved into the dataframe as a separate attribute, but also provides a way to keep track of the records for the purposes of splitting them up between training, test, and validation sets for an ML algorithm should our work come to that."
